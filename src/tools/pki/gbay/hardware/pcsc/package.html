	Classes for detecting smart cards and smart card readers via the PCSC
	interface.
	<p>
		This package is an attempt to make j4sign to operate seamlessly with
		PKCS#11 tokens provided by different italian Certification
		Authorities;<br> The {@link
		tools.pki.gbay.hardware.pcsc.PCSCHelper} class tries to detect token
		readers and tokens, proposing, if possible, a candidate criptoki. (The
		criptoki is the native library implementing the PKCS#11 standard).<br>
		<code>PCSCHelper</code>
		uses the <a href="http://www.opencard.org">OpenCard</a> PCSC JNI
		wrapper.
	<p>The obvious prerequisite is a working PCSC layer; this is
		usually true if a smart card reader has been succesfully installed on
		the system.
